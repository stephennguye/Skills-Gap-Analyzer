# Skills Gap Analyzer  
An early prototype that **analyzes a resume against a chosen job role** and highlights:  
- **Match percentage score**  
- **Missing required & nice-to-have skills**  
- **Recommended courses/resources**  

---

## Why This Matters  
Today’s job market changes quickly, and students often don’t know what skills they’re missing for a target career. This tool shows how AI can **bridge the gap between education and industry needs** by automatically:  
1. Extracting skills from a resume  
2. Comparing them to curated job role templates  
3. Prioritizing what to learn next

## Current Prototype  
You paste **resume text** 

You select **target job role** 

You click **Analyze**  

You get:  
  - A **percentage fit score**  
  - A list of **missing skills**  
  - A **learning plan with resources**  
Example:  
> *Resume vs. Data Analyst* → **68% fit** → Missing *SQL, Tableau, Statistics* → Suggested resources linked.
